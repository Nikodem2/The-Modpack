## Guidelines

### Naming conventions

A Lua file should only define a **maximum** of **one class**. Classes should be named in PascalCase.  
If a Lua file defines a class, it should be named ``<ClassName>.lua``.

### Folder structure

**Folder names** inside ``Scripts/`` should be in lowercase.  
**Interactable class** files should be located in ``Scripts/interactable/``.  
**Tool class** files should be located in ``Scripts/tool/``.  
**Libraries and utility scripts** should be located in ``Scripts/libs/``.  
**Json data files** should be located in ``Scripts/data/`` and be named in underscore_case (e.g. shape_database.json).

### Source control

Before you start working on your own changes make sure to pull the latest **upstream** changes. (Changes on the SMTheGuild 'The Modpack' repository)  
You can do this by going to your forked repository in browser and clicking the 'Fetch upstream' button.
‚ö†Ô∏è Only applies to you if your forked repository (dev!) is <strong><em>behind</em></strong> of <code>SMTheGuild:dev</code>!

### Pull Request == feature

Every pull request you do should only be about few changes. This could be a pull request adding a new feature to a certain part, or editing a language file, or some other change. But not 'some minor changes' here and there without a descriptive theme generalizing all those changes.

#### Good examples:
- "**Fixing typo's**": a pull request where **only** part description typo's are fixed.
- "**Rgb block lua performance fix**": a pull request with changes to fix rgb block performance issues.
- "**Add portal gun**": a pull request that adds the 'portal gun' part (includes *all* required changes; part.json, lua code, language descriptions, ...)

#### BAD examples:
- "**Minor fixes**": a pull request with random whitespace changes, adding comments, changing variable names, delete unused file, ...
- "**Mathblock vector support**": a pull request that adds some feature in the **orienter**

#### Exceptions:
- "**Mod X compatibility support**": a pull request with changes required to have compatibility with mod X without breaking existing functionality.
